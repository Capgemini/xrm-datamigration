# Capgemini CRM Data Migration

## Description

This Data Migration project provides a flexible powerful engine based on the CRM SDK which allows CRM Dynamics Configuration, Reference and Seed data to be extracted, stored in version control and loaded to target instances.  This allows data to be managed in the same way as code and a release can be created that can load the required data to support the released functionality.

## Usage

The engine supports two file formats JSON and CSV and has been used for a number of scenarios on a number of projects.  The engine is extremely flexible and supports the migration of simple reference data entities (e.g. Titles, Countries) to more complex scenarios around Security Roles and Teams.  See wiki for a fuller list of examples (link).
